# Amor Fly - Skill-Based Community Platform

Amor Fly is a growth-focused community where connections happen through shared learning journeys, not photos or profiles. Users choose skills they want to develop and get placed into small anonymous "Flight Pods" of 6 people max.

## 🚀 Features

- **Anonymous Pod Formation**: Algorithm forms pods of up to 6 users based on learning goals
- **Real-time Chat**: Pod members can communicate and share learning resources
- **Reflections System**: Share progress and insights with your pod
- **1:1 Connections**: Limited connections unlocked through engagement and participation
- **Progress Tracking**: Users earn points through reflections, messages, and feedback
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Community-wide insights and metrics
